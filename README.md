# Workshop: Debug like a pro

This repository accompanies the workshop "Debug Like a Pro". 

_The debugger is a tool that lets you inspect your code line by line as it runs, and thereby discover bugs much faster. 
Being able to use the debugger a very valuable skill – no matter what’s your programming level or your role.
